- need to have an encryption interface
- need to have a deflate interface with default
- should have a positionable input stream to go back and fix the file header with CRC/sizes
- could also have a bufferable input stream which holds the deflated bytes until it can write the header and then the bytes
- should be able to iterate over the entries and then iterate over the directory
	- then go back and annotate the entries already recorded in the stream
- should be able to iterate over the directory by skipping the entries
