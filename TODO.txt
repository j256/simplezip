- need to have an encryption interface
- could also have a bufferable input stream which holds the deflated bytes until it can write the header and then the bytes
	- should dump to disk after X bytes and give up after Y bytes and just write data-descriptor
- need to publish some sort of header without the details so that they can get filled in by the writer
- need to write the directory end all with writer supplied information
- need to figure out the dos and the unix permissions
- need to figure out how to do the extra blocks, maybe hashmap of name/values?
- should be able to iterate over the entries and then iterate over the directory
	- then go back and annotate the entries already recorded in the stream
- need a validation process to check all data and report back if file-header or other crc's or sanity checks is off
- add a position-able input-stream and be able to read in the central directory entries before we read the file entries
