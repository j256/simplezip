- need to have an encryption interface
- need to figure out how to do the extra blocks, maybe hashmap of name/values?
- should be able to iterate over the entries and then iterate over the directory
	- then go back and annotate the entries already recorded in the stream
- need a validation process to check all data and report back if file-header or other crc's or sanity checks is off
- add a position-able input-stream and be able to read in the central directory entries before we read the file entries
- be able to add additional encoder/decoders
- maybe a writeDirectoryEntry() call to ZipFileOutput
- do we need the ability to adjust the size+crc in the header after they've been cached/buffered?
- extract name, permissions, modification time, input file
