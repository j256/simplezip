1.2: 5/??/2024
	* Removed the ZipVersion which seemed artificial.  Replaced with major/minor numbers.
	* Some method renaming about the version-needed and version-made getters and setters.
	* Renamed the ZipFileOutput.enableBufferedOutput() method to enableFileBuffering().
	* Added some methods to extract the ZipFileHeader and the ZipCentralDirectoryFileInfo fields from a File.
	* Added some support for Zip64 extra fields.  Not quite full Zip64 support yet.
	* Changed some of the sizes returned to be longs to better handle 32-bit numbers.

1.1: 5/23/2024
	* Fixed some of the logic to allow us to control all bytes in the output Zip.
	* Fixed some of the logic which determined if a data-descriptor was necessary.
	* Added ZipCentralDirectoryEndInfo to be able to control the end structure.
	* Added ZipFileCopy example program which writes identical Zip files.
	* Added some default values to couple of the structures that can be overridden.

1.0: 5/22/2024
	* Fixed a problem with early stream-closing.  Surprised I didn't catch this earlier.
	* Started to add some code examples.

0.9: 5/21/2024
	* Added auto-skipping of file-data in ZipFileInput if you didn't read any data or didn't read to the end.
	* Added initial documentation.  Caused a lot of class renaming.
	* Renamed some modified date/time fields in the ZipFileHeader and ZipCentralDirectoryFileEntry.
	* Renamed DataDescriptor to ZipDataDescriptor.
	* Renamed CentralDirectoryFileHeader to ZipCentralDirectoryFileEntry.
	* Renamed CentralDirectoryFileInfo to ZipCentralDirectoryFileInfo.
	* Renamed CentralDirectoryEnd to ZipCentralDirectoryEnd.

0.8: 5/21/2024
	* Renamed ZipFileReader and ZipFileWriter to ZipFileInput and ZipFileOutput.
	* Added assigning permissions to files written by ZipFileInput.

0.7: 5/20/2024
	* Added better support for Unix and MSDOS file permissions.
	* Added reading from ZipFileReader and writing to a File directly.
	* Added support for writing file-data to the ZipFileWriter via an OutputStream.
	* Added support for reading file-data from the ZipFileReader via an InputStream.
	* Added with...() method chaining to some of the builder classes.
	* Fixed problems with streaming Zip files inside of Zip files because of possibility of reading past the inner one.
	* Fixed problems with compression level flags.

0.6: 5/16/2024
	* Added ZipFileReader.readRaw... and ZipFileWriter.writeRaw... methods for dealing with unencoded data.
	* Some method and field renames as things stabilize and test coverage grows.
	* Added buffering to the ZipFileWriter which can be enabled to fill out ZipFileHeader before writing file data.

0.5: 5/14/2024
	* Improved the test coverage and normalized some of the method names in the process.

0.4: 5/14/2024
	* Fixed sizes and crc which were wrong.  Was tricked by a bad test.  Whoops. 

0.3: 5/14/2024
	* Increased the ZipFileWriter intelligence significantly.
	* Data-descriptor is now written automagically.
	* Central-directory file-header and end are now written automagically.

0.2: 5/13/2024
	* Initial released version mostly just to get the maven repo online.  Not ready for use yet.
	* Reader is pretty useful but the writer is very naive.  Missing a ton of logic.
	* The extra information bytes right now is a work in progress.

0.1: 5/7/2024
	* Initial commit.
