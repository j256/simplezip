<body>

<p> This package provides Java classes to read and write Zip files.  There are a number of
different libraries that do this (including one built into the JDK) but I've not found any
that gave me precise controls over the Zip internal, persisted data structures.  This library
allows you to control the output in all Zip fields which should allow you to read and
re-write Zip files with full precision. </p>

<p> The <a target="_top" href="doc-files/changelog.txt" >change log file</a> shows the various
features and bug fixes in each version. </p>
