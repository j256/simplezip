<body>

<p> This package provides Java classes to read and write Zip files.  There are a number of different libraries that do
this (including one built into the JDK) but I've not found any that gave me precise controls over the Zip file and
directory entries. </p>

<p> The <a target="_top" href="doc-files/changelog.txt" >change log file</a> shows the various features and bug
fixes in each version. </p>
